I’m Devorah—a portrait artist whose creative journey began in rural Georgia, growing up in a household steeped in art and tradition. My early exposure to creativity not only sparked a lifelong passion but also taught me to see the world in vivid colors and intricate details.

Now calling Jerusalem home, I draw inspiration from the city's rich tapestry of history and culture, blending that with the soulful simplicity of my southern roots. I specialize in portraiture, using pencil, charcoal, and oil paints to capture more than just a likeness. For me, each portrait is a personal story—a glimpse into the heart and spirit of the subject, and a reflection of my own artistic evolution.

Art is not just a medium for expression; it’s a journey of discovery, connection, and transformation. I invite you to explore my work and share in the beauty of these moments frozen in time.

Yours,
Dev
